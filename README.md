# ml-experiments
This repository contains various experiments conducted using different algorithm to understand, explore and learn the pros and cons of each with respect to other. The ReadMe file contains findings about each algorithm in details.

1. Ensemble Learning

    Two experiments are done basically:
    
    1. Implementing Voting Classifier using multiple training algorithms
    
    2. Implementing Stacking by creating a Blender based on predictions from different classifiers and training a new classifier on those predictions.
